# React-C-ClientApp-RFC
This is the ClientApp folder for the C# React template. Class components have been replaced with the more modern functional components.

Most devs find React functional components easier to work with. I took the time to update the default template files from Visual Studio's React template into functional components.

To use this repo just replace the contents of your ClientApp folder in your Visual Studio project with these files.
